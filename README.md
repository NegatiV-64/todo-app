# todo-app

This is very simple to-do app, that is based on the html engine. It uses Bootstrap, font-awesome, jQuery and hamburger icons by Jonathan Suh. This is my first project when I heavily use dynamic html elements that are created by the users. Till now I have created almost everything that I wanted, starting from the basic filter to the editing the content of the to-do cards.

But still, I have some plans about this html-based app:
1. Add the feature of changing the tag of the card, while editing it. 

2. Improve animations. For now, they are generic and look quite awful. 

3. Adapt the webpage for the mobile devices.

4. Try to connect the card with the Google sheets, where they can be stored.
